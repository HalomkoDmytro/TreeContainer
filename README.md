Next Generation NewsRoom: Test
Overview
Design and implement generic container for items in a tree of arbitrary structure. Container allows the
following:
1. store items
2. build/modify/access tree structure
- add/remove children of a particular parent
- get subtrees starting from the particular parent
3. search for items based on filters
Functional Requirements
To_do (required):
- design and implement classes required to build generic tree structure
- design and implement generic search interface(s)
- implement search interface(s) for any type of data as example of search filter usage (search
component is expected to handle any arbitrary filters for any arbitrary data type)
- meaningful exception handling
- search for items based on filters
To_do (optional)
- design and implement tree manager allowing to define max child count based on the parent node
- design and implement meaningful event model so it provides ability for the clients to react on tree
structure modifications

Techical Requirements
Required:
- gradle project
- java for main classes implementation
- package: com.globallogic.test.tree
- design patterns where they fit
- source delivery: github or acrhive
Optional
- using groovy SPOCK framework for testing

Delivery Time
Expected implementation time:
4-6 hours.
If stated time is not enough, please, spend any sensible amount required to provide decent implementation.
This task is expected to reflect you expertise and knowledge so be wise trading off time and quality.
NOTE
You are expected to implement your understanding of the requirements (todos) listed above. However if
you are absolutely bewildered by some of them, please, feel free to clarify (send your questions to the
contact person who’s provided this task for you).
